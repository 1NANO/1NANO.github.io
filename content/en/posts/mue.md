# Presentation

MUE is a short first-person horror experience filled with symbolic echoes and a blood-curdling atmosphere. This university capstone project was completed in 4 months with the help of 2 other programmers and 16 artists.

In 1890, a young woman named Alicia wakes up in a gloomy building. As she dives into this twisting maze, increasingly terrifying events unfold. She will have to confront her fear of growing old in order to survive by exploring this environment, a grotesque reflection of the thread of her life.

Will you have the courage to overcome your fears? MUE invites you into a disconnected universe where our deepest anxieties come to life. There is only one thing here that can save you.

Memento Mori.

# Mechanics

### Sanity
Sanity in the game influences visibility as well as the player's movement speed. You can breathe by holding LT and RT which starts the breathing process.

### Seamless cinematic
This system allows the camera and player movements to be interpolated during cutscenes so that there is no cut at the beginning and the end.

### Crawl
At one point, the player is led to lean down and enter a chimney. Since space is therefore limited, a special mechanic has been designed to be able to move the player through this tunnel.

### AI
At the end of the game, the player copes with the old grace. It has several predefined paths so you don't always move the same way. The player must therefore try to sneak around without being seen.

# Programming

This entire project was programmed in C++ with little use of Blueprints for certain basic elements.
