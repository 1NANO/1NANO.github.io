# Presentation

Blibli's Playground of Ego Death is a game made during the 19th edition of the Creative Jam organized by PolyGames and the UQAC-NAD school! I was accompanied by another programmer and 5 artists to create this game in just 48 hours. We won the artistic prize thanks to this game.

The aim of the game is to wander through the imagination of the character Blibli and find the most "Ego wizard" to help bring his fractured mind together and recharge his "Ego power". On the other hand, you are not alone in this world. A monster is hunting you down and your only way to repel it is to use your "Ego Power". This is a first-person arcade-style game where the goal is to reach the highest score without dying.

# Mechanics

### Ego power
The “Ego Power” allows roles to be exchanged between Blibli and the monster. Thus, the monster is pushed back and receives damage until it eventually disappears.

### Visual effects
When the player uses the "Ego Power", several visual effects take place. Below, the "material function" allows you to create a sinusoidal effect on the ground around the player.

### Monster
The monster will constantly run towards the player and will respawn after a while when killed. Stressful music starts playing when the monster is near the player.

# Programming
Since the game was made during a Game Jam, this project was done in Blueprints.
