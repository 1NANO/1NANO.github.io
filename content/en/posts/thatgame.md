# Presentation

THAT GAME is a game made during the Game Jam Funni Jam #2 for 3 days. I was the only programmer on the project accompanied by 4 artists. We won the first place prize during this Game Jam!

The principle of the game is simple, you are the only employee of a toy store and the new sensation "THAT GAME" has just been released! Everyone wants one. The toys in the back room aren't so happy about it and will stop at nothing to stop you from getting those damn boxes. The game includes 5 levels all located in the same rooms but with increasing difficulty in relation to the number of enemies and boxes that you must find.

# Mechanics

### Combat
The game is played in first person with two combat mechanics. The player can use the punch pistol to deal damage to enemies and the magic hourglass to freeze them in place.

### Enemies
There are several enemies, some use Unreal's simple pathfinding to move around the environment and others are static.

### Interaction
The interaction system is rather simple but functional! The game will find the best possible interaction through a series of parameters. Thus, it is not possible to have two interactions simultaneously and they must not be obstructed by other elements of the environment.

# Programming
Since the game was made during a Game Jam and I was the only programmer, this project was done in Blueprints.
