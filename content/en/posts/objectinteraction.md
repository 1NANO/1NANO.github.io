# What is Onset?

Onset is a game available on Steam developed by Blue Montains. It is an open-world multiplayer sandbox with no predefined objectives where players can create their own rules through "Lua" scripts. When the game was released on December 13, 2019, there was already a strong presence of players interested in roleplaying. Thus, the very first Onset servers were roleplay servers allowing players to play the role of bandit, policeman, civilian, etc.

# Object Interaction Package

Barely 8 days after the game's release, I published a "mod" that allows you to pick up objects in order to move them and store them in a vehicle. The goal of this "package" was to allow servers to add these mechanics in order to deepen the gameplay elements available.
